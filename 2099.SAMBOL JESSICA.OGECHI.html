            <p1> <b>welcome to my world</b></p1>
            <p2>my name is sambol jessica ogechi,a final year Mass communication student of babcock university and this is my take on Babcock university in the past 4 years of schooling.</p2>
              <p3> Over the past few years,its been very awesome,stressful, experiential and most of all fun schooling in Babcock university.</p3>
               <p4>I want to thank the good Lord for always providing for my parents, where other people find it hard the Lord always make it easy for me it is undeniable that Babcock mounts alot of pressure on its students,
                well i guess it's for our own best.</p4>
            <p5>Babcock has not only taught me academically but has also strengthened me spiritually (i thank God for grace chapel choir) not to forget the social aspect too,</p5>
            <p6>i met amazing people during the past few years in babcock the likes of (Tolu,Dorcas,Ala,Mercy and many more).</p6>
 <p7>For me, Babcock is not just only a learning ground,but also a morality booster;it has strengthened my morals so much in the way i talk to people, my actions towards certain things people say or do to me,</p7>
    <p8>the way i worship my Creator; in all truism it shapened me in alot of way. one advise i would like to give to people coming into the university is,</p8>
        <p9>be mindful of the friends you make or keep as the case maybe,because it is true that your friends can either make or mar you!.</p9>
             <p10>being in final year is the most stressful thing I have experienced,from loads of assignment to project to choir rehearsals to alot of draining things.</p10> 
             <p11>as a matter of fact i can't keep track of how many times i had a mental break down during the past fews months,but its's all for the best KNOW THAT!!!!</p11>
             <p12>i'm super duper grateful to GOD ALMIGHTY for bring me this far and also Babcock university for giving me the opportunity to find and explore myself</p12>
                                          <p13>    <B>THANK YOU FOR READING</B> </p13>
